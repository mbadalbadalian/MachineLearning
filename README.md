# MachineLearning

## Interesting Topics Explored

### 1. Dataset Feature Selection
Created linear regression predictors using  forward-stepwise selection. Ranked features using K-fold cross-validation. Decreased testing error by applying basis expansion. Achieved a F1 score above 0.97 in all test cases

### 2. Binary Classification
Classified benign and malignant tumors using logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors. Tested various thresholds by measuring the misclassification rate, F1 score and plotting the precision/recall curve. Selected optimal classifier using K-fold cross-validation.

### 3. Ensemble Methods
Classified spam and non-spam emails using decision trees, bagging, boosting, and random forests methods. Optimized classifiers using K-fold cross- validation.

### 4. Neural Network Classifier
Classified banknotes as authentic or forgery  using a neural network with two hidden layers. Optimized number of neurons using a cross-entropy loss function. Improved parameter values using stochastic gradient descent. Eliminated underfitting/overfitting by implementing weight decay regularization. Decrease runtime by integrating early stopping
